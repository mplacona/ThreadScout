        "body": "I’ve been asked to build a KYC system. We’ll start with a small MVP:\n\n* Collect user info,\n* Store it in a database,\n* Include basic authentication.\n\nI've been debating with the right stack - especially for the frontend.\n\nI love the DX of frameworks like Next.js, React Router, Solid, Svelte, and Astro. But they all ship extra JavaScript that users don’t need. For a little-to-no-interactive small app, that feels like overkill.\n\n(I love the snapiness of a mimialminimal JS-free site!) \n\nI’m debating:\n\n* **Qwik**: It's a framework. But, minimal JS is shipped to the browser. I'm unsure if it’s easy for new teammates to pick up or it becomes too niche (Remember we're in a B2B setting and long term support matters)\n* **HTMX**: I like it a lot, but then my head starts spinning with the details:\n   * **Minification** – What tool should I use? Vite/Rollup expect a single entry file, but I’d need something that handles JS per path. Gulp could work, but that means writing my own build pipeline.\n   * **Components** – Frameworks like React/Svelte make components simple and give me SSR. With Web Components (even with Lit), I run into issues like Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC). There are SSR options for Web Components, but I haven’t tried them yet.\n   * **Critical CSS** – I’d like to extract and inline important CSS for faster loads.\n\n\n\nI once tried Go + HTMX, but I went back to Remix because:\n\n* components in HTMX felt too verbose,\n* I had to manage a full build system,\n* orchestrating JS file loads was painful.\n\n\n\n\n\nI’d love to “go back to the platform” (just HTML + JS), but all the old problems come back.\n\n\n\nI’m sure I’m missing something. Any ideas?",

But even I had to unlearn a bunch of habits when I started using AI tools.\n\nThe biggest one was accepting that I don't need to understand every line of code anymore. I love coding and actually enjoyed writing everything from scratch, learning how each piece worked. But when you're trying to ship MVPs while working a day job, using AI just makes more sense financially (as much as it hurts my ego lol).\n\nI still think real coding knowledge is irreplaceable though. The AI generates code but you need to know what to ask for and whether the output makes sense. I've seen people with zero coding experience try to build with these tools and fail immediatley.\n\nMy stack now is Cursor/Claude Code for writing code (recently been trying out Codex too), Chatgpt/Claude for planning mvps, Claude when I need to understand something complex, coderabbit for finding issues in PRs and v0 for quick UI components. I use Perplexity (which I got for free) too depending on what I'm building. It's definitely faster than my old workflow.\n\nThe hardest part was letting go of the craftsman mentality. I used to take pride in wiritng clean code myself. Now I ship \"good enough\" code that works, even if I didn't write most of it.\n\nI still feel like something is lost in the process. The deep understanding you get from struggling problems yourself just isn't there anymore. But for building MVPs as a side hustle, AI tools are basically mandatory now if you want to compete.\n\nWould love to hear from actual senior devs how they dealt with this transition :)",

The move from RxJS to signals is a huge shift, but it feels like a lot of developers (even seasoned seniors) are getting left behind. We constantly see the same struggles on our end:\n\n* \"What's the right way to manage state now?\"\n* \"How do I even start migrating old code?\"\n* \"Should I use a signal or an observable here?\"\n\nOutdated tutorials and conflicting advice are making the modern workflow an absolute mess to figure out for everyone.\n\nSo we made a **workshop** to cut the crap and get straight to what matters. This isn't some boring lecture; it's a legit, hands-on session where we tackle these problems head-on. The highlight? We're migrating a full shopping cart from RxJS to signals and walking through every decision we make along the way.\n\nFYI, we're keeping it small and focused, so spots are pretty scarce. If you're a newcomer or even a vet feeling lost with the new Angular paradigm, this might be the solution.\n\n**Code: ANGULAR60** for 60% off (ends September 14).\n\n**Link in comments for anyone interested. Just ask!**",

It scans your entire project to find issues and suggests fixes.\n\n**Features**\n\n* Detects legacy patterns (e.g., string refs, Legacy Context) that break React Compiler.\n* Flags impure renders (e.g., fetch, setTimeout in render).\n* Identifies improper hook usage (e.g., hooks in loops, conditions, or outside React components).\n* Catches direct state mutations and dynamic objects that prevent memoization.\n* Provides actionable suggestions to fix issues.\n\nI quietly published it 3 months ago, didn’t announce it anywhere, and just noticed it’s already getting weekly downloads, so I thought I’d finally share it here with the community.\n\n🔗 npm: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-compiler-check](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-compiler-check)\n\n🔗 GitHub: [https://github.com/hmadhsan/react-compiler-check](https://github.com/hmadhsan/react-compiler-check)\n\nWould love to hear your feedback and ideas on how to make it more useful 🙌",

Not every \"live\" feature needs real-time latency.\n\nWhere sub-second actually matters:\n\n- Video calls/meetings (obvious)\n- Live auctions or betting\n- Interactive gaming streams\n- Remote assistance/support\n- Live collaboration tools\n\nWhere 3-5 seconds is fine:\n\n- Webinars\n- Live shopping shows\n- Sports streaming\n- Concert broadcasts\n- Most \"live\" events\n\nOur mistake was treating everything like it needed WebRTC. Built this complex mesh network, then SFU setup, dealing with STUN/TURN servers, connection issues, all for use cases where HLS would've been perfectly fine.\n\nNow we segment by actual latency requirements. Using agora for the truly interactive stuff where milliseconds matter. For everything else, standard HLS with CDN distribution. Saved us massive complexity and infrastructure costs.\n\nThe interesting part is users can't even tell the difference in most cases. They care more about quality and reliability than whether the stream is 500ms or 5 seconds behind real-time.\n\nBiggest lesson: ask yourself if you're building video conferencing or video broadcasting. The infrastructure requirements are completely different. Most devs default to the complex solution when the simple one would work fine.\n\nWhat latency requirements do you actually have vs what you think you need?",

        "body": "Well to give you some context I've been an in-house frontend dev for about 5 years now at a company that has had a very old tech stack. We're using a static site generator called [Wintersmith](https://github.com/jnordberg/wintersmith).\n\nWhen I first joined the lead developer pretty much warned me that we basically don't \"rock the boat\" by messing with it too much because it is out-dated and there isn't support for it online for help if we were to ever run into something that broke the site.\n\nWith that said, it's been solid for what it does and what we used it for but now the company is at a point where it has gone from maybe 30 people to over 100 people and we have people who are dedicated to creating content (podcasts, blog posts, case studies). Because of this we have out grown our tech stack. We still have a small team of developers and we are looking at having an agency re-do our website, atleast the main portions of it and also build our website on top of a CMS.\n\nI'm not sure what CMS the agency will use but it has been confirmed to me that the agency does build with React. I have very little React experience. I built a 2 static sites with it about 4 years ago, a small typing game and I think that's it.\n\nI will need much more than a React refresher to take this site from the agency and build upon their work. But I figure if I start now, build some projects, use AI as a mentoring tool I have a good chance of having a better than basic understanding of React by the time this project lands in my hands to maintain and build upon.\n\nDo you think this is feasible? My job essentially depends on it.\n\nWith that said is there anything you folks would recommend me do? I like courses but I don't wanna spin my wheels too much on a course. I do better when I learn something then build something with what I learned. Most courses usually are build around 1 major project that you build during the course until the end. I would probably forget 60% of what I learned by the time I got to the end of the course so building multiple smaller projects is usually best for me.\n\nI will probably have to go full stack eventually to maintain this project but atleast for the first few months I anticipate I will only be doing frontend work like building new landing pages\n\n  \nEdit: Let me also say my company is supporting me, knowing I don't know much about React. They're giving me a few hours a week to dedicate to learning React on company time, WHILE also learning in my free time. I essentially have to make a plan, execute it, and succeed. I can't use the excuse \"oh you guys did not give me any time to prepare or get ready for this major tech change\". I have to be ready. ",

        "body": "I work in a ministry and we run the website [swosucatholic.org](http://swosucatholic.org) powered by eCatholic. It's ok, but I'd like to build it out a bit more to not just be a place to get information but could also be a tool that we use frequently in our day-to-day function as a ministry.\n\nI want to find a developer who can built an application we can integrate into our website that should have a few necessary functions for scheduling. We had one scheduler application we used but the developer is no longer supporting it and it lacked some functionality. My question is, given the following necessities for the application, what developer skills should a developer or developer team have and what sort of price range am I looking at to have this built?  \n  \n1. If I have a Bible study on Matthew, a study on Church History, and a prayer group, I'd like for the students to be able to register with an email, name and number and select which study they'd like to sign up for. Ideally I'd have the ability to add, change, or take away studies easily.\n\n2. I'd like the application to then have a grid from Monday - Friday on the x axis and times from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm in 15 minute increments running along the y axis (like an excel spreadsheet). The registrants should then be able to click on the cells of the grid for when they are busy, leaving the times they are free unselected.\n\n3. I would then like to have the ability to review each registrants answers individually and edit them if they made a mistake\n\n4. Most importantly, would be the ability to create a group. For example, if I was creating a prayer group, I'd like to select prayer group to see everyone who had signed up for it. Let's say I have ten. I want to then click on one person and see their availability, and then when I click on the next person's name, narrow down the options to only see the times that work with both people, and so on and so forth as I add more people to the group. The opportunity to create more then one group from several registrants would be ideal.\n\n5. I would then like to track those groups through the semester and have the ability to take attendance\n\n6. The chance to assign roles to people such as group leader or designated Bible Study Brownie Baker, and so forth.\n\nI realize this is a lot and I probably could explain better, but I'm definitely up for answering questions to clarify my needs if it helps me narrow down the type of developer(s) I would need to create such a beast.",

So please do not give me \"Google cannot parse Js\". Even if it cannot, I can deal with it later with a SSR solution.\n\nI have a different kind of problem. I have a language selector, which changes the language for the whole app. That also changes all the SEO tags etc. The problem is that the links are staying the same. About is at /about whether the language is EN or FR.\n\nWhat's the right way to handle this? Should I add the language to the path, such as /en/about, or /about/en?",
