I naively did not set up my LinkedIn account years ago but since taking on a new role, it's part of the requirement for networking. So I made the decision to hop on, sign myself up, pay for business premium, went through the persona verification. Added all my colleagues and people i've known throughout my career, and there is a lot. Throughout the day I was doing this, not in one big block. Next day got an email telling my subscription has been confirmed for LinkedIn Premium but now acocunt has been temporarily disabled. I go looking for any form of help support, find some form to submit any appeals on restrictions and when I press to submit, it auto cancels and takes me to a pointless support page.\n\nSo I'm a paying customer, with legitimate connections, verified, and now it seems account is gone like out of thin air. Sorry but your botting detection software in LinkedIn must be set up by a 3 year old with 2008 tech. What a load of sh\\*te.\n\nAnyone ever had success appealing this?

I’m not able to sign into LinkedIn app or web or sales navigator app too, even after entering correct login details, because LinkedIn sends the OTP to my SIM which is an Indian SIM but I’m in South Korea right now and that SIM doesn’t work here. There was an option to request to sign in by verifying myself and I uploaded my passport too but apparently it takes anywhere between 24 hours to 5 days and it’s too late by then. Please help me out!

Explain that you’re abroad and your SIM can’t receive SMS, and request a manual verification. Include a clear photo of your ID (passport) and mention the urgency so they may expedite the review.\n\nWhile you wait for LinkedIn’s response, try logging in from a trusted device you’ve used before (e.g., a laptop where you stayed signed in) – sometimes LinkedIn will let you confirm the login without needing the OTP.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you get back in quickly!"
