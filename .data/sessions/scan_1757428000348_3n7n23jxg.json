        "body": "An unverified profile from someone who works for a talent and acquisitions firm reached out to me asking me about my profile which they said seemed to stand out to them.  Then they asked for a salary range, to which I asked their budget which was more than double the median salary of the position I would be qualified for.  I asked for the company name and job posting and they provided a job description within the linkedin message but no a link to it.  The company appears to be a smaller company located in Michigan, however the job listing apparently shows they are hiring in my small town where I currently reside in Maine.  I'm super skeptical but the profile has employment history, mainly in financial analytics (which is my skillset) and shows being employed by a talent firm for 2 years.  I'm skeptical on sending my resume until I can verify this person.  Another red flag is they are located in Tanzania and have a personal gmail account referenced on their cover photo on the profile.  \n\nI'm new to this Linkedin thing and don't want to start throwing resumes at a bunch of frauds and not realizing it.",

Here are three concrete steps you can take to verify the recruiter before sharing any details:\n\n1. **Ask for official company contact information** – request a corporate email address (e.g., @company.com) and a phone number. Call the main line listed on the company’s website to confirm the recruiter’s affiliation.\n2. **Search for the job posting yourself** – look up the exact job title on the company’s Careers page or reputable job boards. If the listing can’t be found, that’s a red flag.\n3. **Check the recruiter’s LinkedIn history** – examine the profile for consistency (e.g., a realistic timeline, mutual connections, endorsements). A profile with a personal Gmail address, a location that doesn’t match the company, or very few connections is suspicious.\n\nIf any of these checks fail, it’s safest to walk away. Trust your gut and protect your personal information."
